A solidity implementation of Auction-Mint and its corresponding python simulation.
Our paper will be directed from this repo if published finally (TAT).

## Usage
For Solidity, please refer to [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for executions.

For python simulation, we provide all codes that can be executed at once.
```python
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python src/simulation/main.py
```
Please comment and uncomment corresponding line of codes in 
the main() function of script `src/simulation/main.py` to conduct all simulations in our paper.
